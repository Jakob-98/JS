# F0cus

A HTML, CSS and JavaScript drawing tool which utilises the HTML5 canvas.


# Todo - Should really be migrated to issues...

TO DO: Add a readme. 

TO DO: Add connections between rectangles using a selection button similar to: https://jsfiddle.net/atle_holm/t7v818nk/
Have these connections drag along, and use sharp angles instead of rounded angles

TO DO: Prevent rectangles from being created ontop of eachother by using the coords and their widths/heights. 
Also prevent them from dragging onto eachother - this might help
http://jsfiddle.net/nCBwC/

TO DO: Export the made model using JSON and localStorage
 
TO DO: replace the 1/2 * rect_width... etc with centre var. 

TO DO: make the 'setcreator' a separate parent class of ProcessStep, or make the processMain a child class of the processstep class to improve code readability/expandability.
